# Provides:          jackrabbit
# Short-Description: Start/stop Jackrabbit JCR server.
#
# Description:      This relies on a PID file to check if Jackrabbit is running.
#                   If you kill Jackrabbit without removing the PID file, you
#                   will not be able to start Jackrabbit with this script until
#                   you manually remove the PID file.
#                   Edit the variables below to configure Jackrabbit
#                   Depending on the storage backend, you might want to adjust
#                   the required start / stop lines.
#
# Default-Start:    2 3 4 5
# Default-Stop:     0 1 6
# Required-Start:
# Required-Stop:
