# Symfony Content Management Framework Sandbox

This sandbox is a testing ground for the cmf bundles being developped.

It is based on the [Symfony Standard edition](https://github.com/symfony/symfony-standard) and adds all cmf related bundles on top of the standard edition bundles.

Link to the [live demo](http://cmf.liip.ch)

## Getting started

You can run the sandbox on your system, or in a virtualbox VM using Vagrant. For the latter, see
"Getting started using Vagrant"

### You will need:
  * Git 1.6+
  * PHP 5.3.2+
  * php5-intl
  * phpunit 3.5+ (optional)

## Get the code

    git clone git://github.com/symfony-cmf/cmf-sandbox.git
    cd cmf-sandbox
    # we skipped the web installer for now
    # copy parameters template and edit as needed
    cp app/config/parameters.yml.dist app/config/parameters.yml
    bin/vendors install

This will fetch the main project and all it's dependencies ( Cmf Bundles, Symfony, Doctrine\PHPCR, Jackalope ... )
Please also adjust the ``app/config/parameters.yml`` as needed. Specifically pick the PHPCR backend and adjust
the URL and database configurations accordingly.

### Install and run Apache JackRabbit

Follow the guide in the [Jackalope Wiki](https://github.com/jackalope/jackalope/wiki/Running-a-jackrabbit-server).
You can also use a different PHPCR implementation but this is what is most tested.


## Prepare the phpcr repository

First you need to create a workspace that will hold the data for the sandbox.
The default parameters.yml defines the workspace to be 'sandbox'. You can
change this of course. If you do, also adjust the following command.

    app/console doctrine:phpcr:workspace:create sandbox

Once your workspace is set up, you need to [register the node types](https://github.com/doctrine/phpcr-odm/wiki/Custom-node-type-phpcr%3Amanaged) for phpcr-odm:

    app/console doctrine:phpcr:register-system-node-types


## Import the fixtures

The admin backend is still in an early stage. Until it improves, the easiest is
to programmatically create data. The best way to do that is with the doctrine
data fixtures. The DoctrinePHPCRBundle included in the symfony-cmf repository
provides a command to load fixtures.

    app/console -v doctrine:phpcr:fixtures:load

Run this to load the fixtures from the Sandbox MainBundle.


## Access by web browser

Create an apache virtual host entry along the lines of
<Virtualhost *:80>
    Servername cmf.lo
    DocumentRoot /path/to/symfony-cmf/cmf-sandbox/web
    <Directory /path/to/symfony-cmf/cmf-sandox>
        AllowOverride All
    </Directory>
</Virtualhost>

And add an entry to your hosts file for cmf.lo

Then point your browser to http://cmf.lo/app_dev.php


## Production environment

In order to run the sandbox in production mode at http://cmf.lo/
you need to generate the doctrine proxies:

    app/console cache:warmup --env=prod --no-debug


# Getting started using Vagrant

## You will need:
  * Git 1.6+
  * Nfs (MacOS works OOB, on Debian based linux distributions install nfs-kernel-server package)
  * [Vagrant](http://vagrantup.com)

## Get the code

    git clone git://github.com/symfony-cmf/cmf-sandbox.git
    cd cmf-sandbox
    # we skipped the web installer for now
    # copy parameters template and edit as needed
    cp app/config/parameters.yml.dist app/config/parameters.yml
    cd vagrant
    vagrant up
    vagrant ssh
    bin/vendors install

This will fetch the main project and all it's dependencies ( Cmf Bundles, Symfony, Doctrine\PHPCR, Jackalope ... )

## Jackrabbit

Afterwards you will need to manually register the system node types and import the fixtures as explained above.

## Access by web browser

Optionally add an entry to your hosts file for cmf.lo pointing to 33.33.33.10, then point your browser to http://cmf.lo/app_dev.php
Or go straight to http://33.33.33.10/app_dev.php

# Other hints

## Console

The PHPCR ODM Bundle provides a couple of useful commands in the doctrine:phpcr namespace.
Type app/console to see them all.

## Admin interface

There is a proof-of-concept admin interface using the SonataPhpcrAdminBundle at
http://cmf.lo/app_dev.php/admin/dashboard

Basically you have paginated lists for two types of documents. You create new documents, edit and delete them. Some filtering is available in the list. This bundle is an implementation of [Sonata Admin Bundle](https://github.com/sonata-project/SonataAdminBundle)

At the moment there is no notion of parents and sons in the admin bundle.

## Run the test suite

Tests are written with PHPUnit.

TESTS ARE CURRENTLY BROKEN

    phpunit -c app
